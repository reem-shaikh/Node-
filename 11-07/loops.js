//Types of loops / Iterations:

//while loop
//we dont know how many times these will execute 
while(10 > 5){
    // metro 
    console.log('entry controlled loop')
    // goes into infinite loop
}

do {
   // local 
   console.log('exit controlled loop')
} while(10 < 5)

//for loop - we know the entry and exit points
